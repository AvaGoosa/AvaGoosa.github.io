Hiya!
This is just my personal website's git repo :3

This is actually managed via an ExpressJS NGINX reverse proxy, but the [git page is still up](https://git.avagoosa.com) if my personal server goes down!

If you ever want to reverse-engineer the site or grab the resources, you can just download the git repo as a ZIP:
