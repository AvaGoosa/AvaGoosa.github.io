## Echo VR (v987566) v63+ Installation Guide
This isn't updated as much as the [website](https://fox595676.github.io), so I recommend using that instead!

*The video tutorials are a little bodged, I messed up and let the browser close therefore losing my Echo ZIP download, hence the split recording.*

*Leave it running to let it download completely to continue!*

### Prerequisites

- Echo VR previously in your account (I will be updating this soon to include how to do it without).
- A Quest 2 (the 3 does work, but via extra steps that I'll figure out soon).
- Developer mode enabled.
- Join [this server](https://discord.gg/echo-vr-lounge) on Discord (don't leave it as it manages your account).

**PLEASE** don't ask for help until you really need it. Go to **#help-base** first!

- You don’t need a computer!

### Download the following files

- [ZArchiver](https://apkpure.com/zarchiver/ru.zdevs.zarchiver) - used for root access file management and installing APKs.
- [Activity Launcher](https://apkpure.com/activity-launcher/de.szalkowski.activitylauncher) - to open the Android Settings.
- [Shizuku](https://apkpure.com/shizuku/moe.shizuku.privileged.api) - to get root access.
- [Echo VR files](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yjC3D4TTelqOiZFTmVR311vM8Rr9mc9z/view?usp=drivesdk) - Echo VR APK and OBB - the most important part!

### Installation Method

You can skip this if you already have an installation method and just install the APKS :3. Or follow [this guide](https://youtu.be/tvOfS1wUsvw?si=cdF2ROAD6RAep1CF&t=63) (sorry about the quality I couldn't find any better ones).

1. Download [Mobile VR Station](https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/mobile-vr-station/3887008398005125/) from the Quest store and open it.
2. Click on “Configuration Wizard” > “Show All Options” > “Configure Scoped Storage”.
3. Click on “Step 1: Request Access”.
4. At the top, click on “Quest 2”, or in other words go to the base directory.

5. Click on “Downloads”.
6. Click on the enlarge icon on all the APKS (including the Echo VR APK), then Continue and Install - clicking open doesn’t do anything!

### Enabling a second developer mode and using Shizuku to get root access

1. Open Android Launcher.
2. Scroll down until you find "Settings", if you have Roblox installed, it should be directly below it (Not “Android System”!).
3. Click on it, and press the first item in the list, then "Launch Activity".
4. Scroll down to About Phone, then spam “Build Number” at the bottom until you become a developer!
5. Go back and click on “System” then “Developer Options”.
6. Turn on USB Debugging if it’s off, then turn on Wireless Debugging below it and click on the text.
7. Put this tab into split screen and open Shizuku.
8. Click on “Pair” in the wireless option, then enter the code on the second screen after clicking on add new device.

### Access Root Files

1. Turn on USB Debugging if it’s off, then turn on Wireless Debugging below it and click on the text.
2. Put this tab into split screen and open Shizuku.
3. Click on “Pair” in the wireless option, then enter the code on the second screen after clicking on add new device.
4. You’re now able to access root files! Try to keep both these apps open (although don't worry if it's a pain, it's not the end of the world if they get minimised, just don't click the X!) and move on to the next step :)

---

### Move the OBB File

1. Open ZArchiver while keeping Shizuku open and click on settings, then ROOT, then click on the first option and set it to “Shizuku”. Turn on all the toggles after that!
2. Go to your Downloads in ZArchiver while keeping everything open and find the zipped file, then extract it into your downloads.
3. Go into your newly created folder and install the Echo APK by clicking on it then install.
4. Once it's done installing, hold down on the OBB file and click copy (or move if you're confident, it’s just in case something goes wrong!).
5. Click on the top file named .. and go back to the directory where Downloads is. Navigate to “Android” > “obb”.
6. A prompt should pop up in Shizuku, click on Allow, then click on "obb" in ZArchiver again.
7. Go to “com.readyatdawn.r15” and click on the paste button in the bottom right (even if it says access denied).

*If you can't find it, try launching Echo (it will instantly crash - click on Open App - NEVER Restore, which is the blue button) then moving the OBB file again!*

8. There you go! You should have successfully installed Echo VR!

### Launch Echo VR

For me it crashed a few times so if it does for you, simply force quit it, by going back to the Android Settings thing and clicking on Apps then “Force Quit” on Echo VR.

1. Go to the server, then go to any typeable channel, then type in /link and click on the command that shows up, then enter your code!
