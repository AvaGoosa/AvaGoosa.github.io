    <i>The video tutorials are a little bodged. I messed up and let the browser close therefore losing my Echo ZIP download, hence the split recording.
    <p>Leave it running to let it download completely to continue!</i></p>

        <h2>Installation Method</h2>
        <p>You can skip this if you already have an installation method and just install the APKS :3</p>
        Or follow <a href="https://youtu.be/tvOfS1wUsvw?si=cdF2ROAD6RAep1CF&t=63" target="_blank">this guide</a> (sorry about the quality I couldn't find any better ones)
        <ol>
            <li>Download Mobile VR Station (MVS) from the Quest store and open it</li>
            <li>Click on “Configuration Wizard” > “Show All Options” > “Configure Scoped Storage”</li>
            <li>Click on “Step 1: Request Access”</li>
            <li>At the top, click on “Quest 2”, or in other words go to the base directory</li>
            <img src="MVSDIR.jpg" style="width:500px;">
            <li>Click on “Downloads”</li>
            <li>Click on the enlarge icon on all the APKS (including the Echo VR APK) then Continue and Install - clicking open doesn’t do anything!</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Enabling a second developer mode and using Shizuku to get root access</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open Android Launcher</li>
            <li>Scroll down until you find "Settings", if you have Roblox installed, it should be directly below it. Not “Android System”!
            <li>Click on it, and press the first item in the list, then "Launch Activity"</li>
            <li>Scroll down to About Phone, then spam “Build Number” the bottom until you become a developer!</li>
            <li>Go back and click on “System” then “Developer Options”.</li>
            <li>Turn on USB Debugging if it’s off, then turn on Wireless Debugging below it and click on the text.</li>
            <li>Put this tab into split screen and open Shizuku</li>
            <li>Click on “Pair” in the wireless option, then enter the code on the second screen after clicking on add new device.</li>
            <li>now able to access root files! Try to keep both these apps open (although don't worry if it's a pain, it's not the end of the world if they get minimised, just don't click the X!) and move on to the next step :)</li>
        </ol>

    
    <section>
        <h2>Access Root Files</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Turn on USB Debugging if it’s off, then turn on Wireless Debugging below it and click on the text.</li>
            <li>Put this tab into split screen and open Shizuku</li>
            <li>Click on “Pair” in the wireless option, then enter the code on the second screen after clicking on add new device.</li>
            <li>You’re now able to access root files! Try to keep both these apps open (although don't worry if it's a pain, it's not the end of the world if they get minimised, just don't click the X!) and move on to the next step :)</li>
        </ol>

    <section>
        <h2>Move the OBB File</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Open ZArchiver while keeping Shizuku open and click on settings, then ROOT, then click on the first option and set it to “Shizuku”. Turn on all the toggles after that!</li>
            <li>Go to your Downloads in ZArchiver while keeping everything open and find the zipped file, then extract it into your downloads.</li>
            <li>Go into your newly created folder and install the Echo APK but clicking on it then install.</li>
            <li>Once it's done installing, hold down on the OBB file and click copy (or move if you're confident, it’s just in case something goes wrong!)</li>
            <li>Click on the top file named .. and go back to the directory where Downloads is. Navigate to “Android” > “obb”</li>
            <li>A prompt should pop up in Shizuku, click on Allow, then click on "obb" in ZArchiver again.</li>
            <li>Go to “com.readyatdawn.r15” and click on the paste button in the bottom right (even if it says access denied)</li>
            <i>If you can't find it, try launching Echo (it will instantly crash - click on Open App - NEVER Restore, which is the blue button) then moving the OBB file again!</i>
            <li>There you go! You should have succesfully installed Echo VR!</li>

    <section>
        <h2>Launch Echo VR</h2> 
        <p><b>DO NOT CLICK ON “Restore”!!!!</b></p>
        For me it crashed a few times so if it does for you, simply force quit it, by going back to the Android Settings thing and clicking on Apps then “Force Quit” on Echo VR.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the server, then go to any typeable channel, then type in /link and click on the command that shows up, then enter your code!</li>
        </ul>
