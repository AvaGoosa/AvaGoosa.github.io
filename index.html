<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>
<p>	⁃	Echo VR previously in your account, I will be editing this to make a tutorial on how to do it without later!
<p>	⁃	A Quest 2, the 3 does work, but I haven't tested it with this method.
<p>	⁃	Developer mode - follow <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jB1gwgSpU3E" target="_blank">this guide I stole</a> if you haven't already
<p>

<h2>First up!</h2>
Find Echo VR in your app list, install it, launch it, cry at it being discontinued, then uninstall it and proceed!

<h2>Download the following files:</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://apkpure.com/zarchiver/ru.zdevs.zarchiver" target="_blank">ZArchiver</a> - used for root access file management and installing IPAs
<p>
<a href="https://apkpure.com/activity-launcher/de.szalkowski.activitylauncher"  target="_blank">Activity Launcher</a> - to open the Android Settings
<p>
<a href="https://apkpure.com/shizuku/moe.shizuku.privileged.api"  target="_blank">Shizuku</a> - to get root access
<p>
<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yjC3D4TTelqOiZFTmVR311vM8Rr9mc9z/view?usp=drivesdk"  target="_blank">Echo VR files</a> - Echo VR APK and OBB - the most important part!

<p>

<h2>You can skip this if you already have a method and just install the APKS :3</h2>
(or follow <a href="https://youtu.be/tvOfS1wUsvw?si=cdF2ROAD6RAep1CF&t=63" target="_blank">this guide</a> (sorry about the quality I couldn't find any better ones)) 
<p>	1.	Download <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/mobile-vr-station/3887008398005125/"  target="_blank">Mobile VR Station</a> (MVS) from the Quest store and open it
<p>	2.	Click on “Configuration Wizard” > “Show All Options” > “Configure Scoped Storage”
<p>	3.	Click on “Step 1: Request Access”
<p>	4.	At the top, click on “Quest 2”, or in other words go to the base directory
<p>	<img src="MVSDIR.jpg" style="width:500px;">
<p>	5.	Click on “Downloads”
<p>	6.	Click on the enlarge icon on all the APKS (excluding the Echo VR APK if you haven't extracted it) then Continue and Install - clicking open doesn’t do anything, so just click done and move onto the next one until you've installed all of them!
<p>	7. All done! Close Mobile VR Station and open unverified sources to go onto the next step :3

<p>

<h2>Enabling a second developer mode and using Shizuku to get root access</h2>
<p>	1. Open Android Launcher
<p>	2. Scroll down until you find "Settings", if you have Roblox installed, it should be directly below it. Not “Android System”!
<p> 3. Click on it, and press the first item in the list, then "Launch Activity"
<p>	3. Scroll down to About Phone, then spam “Build Number” the bottom until you become a developer!
<p>	4. Go back and click on “System” then “Developer Options”.
<p>	5. Turn on USB Debugging if it’s off, then turn on Wireless Debugging below it and click on the text.
<p> 6. Put this tab into split screen and open Shizuku
<p>	7. Click on “Pair” in the wireless option, then enter the code on the second screen affter clicking on add new device.
<p> You’re now able to access root files! Try to keep both these apps open (although don't worry if it's a pain, it's not the end of the world if they get minimised, just don't click the X!) and move on to the next step :)

<p>

<h2>Putting the OBB files in their place and installing Echo VR</h2>
<p> 1. Open ZArchiver while keeping Shizuku open and click on settings, then ROOT, then click on the first option and set it to “Shizuku”. Turn on all the toggles after that!
<p> 2. Go to your Downloads in ZArchiver while keeping everything open and find the zipped file, then extract it into your downloads.
<p>	3. Go into your newly created folder and install the Echo APK but clicking on it then install.
<p> 4. Once it's done installing, hold down on the OBB file and click copy (or move if you're confident, it’s just in case something goes wrong!)
<p>	5. Click on the top file named .. and go back to the directory where Downloads is. Navigate to “Android” > “obb” >
<p>	6. A prompt should pop up in Shizuku, click on Allow, then click on "obb" in ZArchiver again.
<p>	7. Go to “com.readyatdawn.r15” and click on the paste button in the bottom right (even if it says access denied)
<p> <i>If you can't find it, try launching Echo (it will instantly crash - click on Open App - NEVER Restore, which is the blue button) then moving the OBB file again!</i>
<p> 8. There you go! You should have succesfully installed Echo VR!

<p>

<h2>Launch Echo VR but don't click on Restore!!!!</h2>
For me it crashed a few times so if it does for you, simply force quit it, by going back to the Android Settings thing and clicking on Apps then “Force Quit” on Echo VR.
