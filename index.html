You can skip this if you already have an installation method and just install the APKS :3
	1.	Download Mobile VR Station (MVS) from the Quest store and open it
	2.	Click on “Configuration Wizard” > “Show All Options” > “Configure Scoped Storage”
	3.	Click on “Step 1: Request Access”
	4.	At the top, click on “Quest 2”, or in other words go to the base directory
	5.	Click on “Downloads”
	6.	Click on the enlarge icon on all the APKS (including the Echo VR APK) then Continue and Install - clicking open doesn’t do anything!



Close down MVS, and open AL. Scroll down until you find “Settings”. If you have Roblox installed, it should be directly below it. Not “Android System”! Then click on Settings again, the first item in the list, and click “Launch Activity”. Scroll down to About Phone, then spam “Build Number” the bottom until you become a developer.
Go back and click on “System” then “Developer Options”.



Turn on USB Debugging if it’s off, then turn on Wireless Debugging. And click on the text. But this tab into split screen and open Shizuku. Click on “Pair” in the wireless option, then enter the code on the second screen. You’re now able to access root files!

Open ZArchiver while keeping Shizuku open and click on settings, then ROOT, then click on the first option and set it to “Shizuku”. Turn on all the toggles after that!

Go to your Downloads in ZArchiver while keeping everything open and find The OBB file. Hold down on it and click copy (or move or whatever it’s just in case something goes wrong yk)

Click on the top file named .. and go back to the directory where Downloads is. Navigate to “Android” > “obb” > “com.readyatdawn.r15” and click on the paste button in the bottom right (even if it says access denied)

Launch Echo VR BUT
# DO NOT CLICK ON “Restore”!!!!
For me it crashed a few times so if it does for you, simply force quit it, by going back to the Android Settings thing and clicking on Apps then “Force Quit” on Echo VR. 


Old broken Echo VR stuff
	•	Echo VR - the most important part! Download the APK file, or copy the torrent link and add it in FDM https://archive.org/details/echo-vr-v-4987566-apk-obb-quest-2
	•	FDM x64 - optional, to download the torrent file instead to if you’re Australian and have shitty internet https://www.freedownloadmanager.org/download-fdm-for-android.htm
